    name: "Nolus defines a money market between lenders looking to yield on stablecoins and borrowers looking to amplify their holdings. For borrowers, the Nolus DeFi Lease provides up to 150% financing on the initial investment with a lowered margin call risk and access to the underlying leveraged assets through whitelisted strategies. Inspired by traditional lease products where one can obtain a physical good by providing only a fraction of the cost upfront and use it throughout the lease duration, the Nolus DeFi Lease unlocks the full potential of crypto money markets by reducing the industry’s steep over-collateralization requirements, resulting in significantly improved capital efficiency",
