      <p>
        2.5. The User further acknowledges that without the Access Data they will not be able to access their Platform
        Wallet and that any third party can access such User’s Waller and procure transactions with any funds available by
        using certain part of the Access Data for this purpose. Therefore, it will be sole and explicit responsibility of
        the User to duly store the Access Data in private and confidential manner.
      </p>

        spot trade for the requested Token Pair, including Exchange Rate and applicable Swap Fees and deductions. Such
        quote shall be valid only if the User completes the operation within the displayed expiry period. If operation is
        not completed before occurrence of the expiry time, the User’s request shall be considered void and the User shall

        6.2. The User understands and acknowledges that Transactional Gas shall always be consumed in NLS native tokens,
        as if the User’s funds are in other denomination of Digital Asset, the Protocol shall automatically procure

        performance of Borrower’s liabilities under the Lease Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. In the case under Section D.VI.2. the Down payment and the Digital Asset, purchased with the Principal, shall
        together be locked as a Collateral in an isolated Lease Smart Contract instance on the Protocol, connected to the
        Waller of the Borrower.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. All locked Digital Assets under this Section VII shall be unlocked only upon full Repayment of the respective
        balance of the Lease (together with all accrued Interest due).
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Each User hereby explicitly agrees that the collateralized Digital Asset shall be used as a property, which the
        Protocol, in case of а Liquidation event, can automatically sell in full or partially in order to pay off part or

      </p>
      <p>
        4. Any partial repayment shall be used firstly to cover any outstanding Interest payment (first Margin Interest
        and then Lease Interest) and the remaining balance shall reduce the outstanding Principal.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. For full Repayment the Borrower should pay an amount equal to the all outstanding Interest and the outstanding
        Principal together with all related fees and costs including transactional costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Upon full Repayment the Protocol will automatically close the Lease and Collateral positions and will unlock
        the full amount of the Digital Asset/s to the Wallet of the Borrower.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Each Payment or Repayment is allowed only in the LPN of the Lease.

          IX. Liability Levels & Re-evaluation
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. All Users hereby acknowledge that the sustainability of the Platform can only be kept as far as an adequate
        balance is always maintained between the Current Price of the Asset (which functions also as Collateral) and the
        current аmount of the Lease (LTV).
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Therefore, the Protocol shall maintain LTV level indicators, which ensure that the аmount of the Lease is
        always kept beneath Max LTV, or otherwise Liquidation under Section D.X is started by the Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. In order to assess the LTV, the Protocol shall regularly procure Re-evaluation., which shall check and reassess
        the Current Asset Value. Re-evaluation shall be based on data gathered from the Market Data Feed.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Based on the Re-evaluation, the Protocol shall monitor the LTV regarding certain Lease.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. When the Asset depreciates, the Protocol shall monitor if the LTV is close to reaching either Healthy LTV
        Liability level or Max LTV.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. In the case under Section D.IX.5. the Protocol shall send to the Borrower Liquidation warning, which will
        contain information on:
      </p>
      <p>
        6.1. the Current Asset Value;
      </p>
      <p>
        6.2. the current LTV regarding the Lease;
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3. information on the amount of the Margin Payment the Borrower should make in order to reach Healthy LTV for
        the Lease;
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Based on the Liquidation warning, the Borrower shall be able to make Margin Payment in LPN by transfer to
        corresponding Lease contract, in which the Collateral is locked.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Should the Borrower fails to make the Margin Payment needed, the Protocol shall trigger the Liquidation process
        under Section D.X.
      </p>
      <p>
        9. For avoidance of any doubt, LTV levels shall be determined by the Protocol for each Lease Contract, based on
        mathematical configurations existing in the Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          X. Liquidation process
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Based on the procedure set in Section D.IX. the Protocol shall be entitled to trigger Liquidation in case the
        LTV reaches Max LTV and provided that the Borrower hasn’t made a sufficient Margin Payment for reaching Healthy
        LTV.

      <p>
        2. In case of LTV reaches Max LTV, the Protocol shall, depending on the case, automatically procure Partial or
        Total Liquidation with respect to the Collateral.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.1. In case of Partial Liquidation the Protocol shall sell a portion of the Collateral, which will generate sales
        revenue to repay the current Lease liability until LTV reaches a Healthy LTV level.
      </p>
      <p>
        2.2. Partial Liquidation shall be triggered each time the LTV reaches the Max LTV.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Total Liquidation shall be the final Liquidation process, in which the Protocol shall sell the balance of the
        Collateral and shall use the proceeds thereof to repay the outstanding Lease liability.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Upon the occurrence of a Total Liquidation event under Section D.X.3., the Lease will be considered terminated

        proceeds of the sale of the collateralized Digital Asset, left after repayment of the Lease (if any).
